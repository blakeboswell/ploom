## Overview

A collection of tools for out-of-memory linear model fitting and
inference. Implements `lm` and `glm` analogs using Alan Miller’s AS274
updating QR factorization algorithm. Collects and reports an array of
pertinent fit statistics. Provides flexible and easy to use mechanisms
to stream in data and stream out results during fitting.
