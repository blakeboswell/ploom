Title: Out-of-memory Linear and Generalized Linear Models 
Description: A collection of tools for out-of-memory linear model fitting and
    inference. Implements `lm` and `glm` analogs using Alan Miller's AS274
    updating QR factorization algorithm. Collects and reports an array of
    pertinent fit statistics. Provides flexible and easy to use mechanisms
    to stream in data and stream out results during fitting.
